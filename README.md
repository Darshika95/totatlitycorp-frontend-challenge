# Apple Website Clone

Clone of Apple website https://www.apple.com/ 

## TechStack Details

## Approach

I followed top-down approach to make up the clone of apple site. Used flexbox to design the components and make it responsive. The carousel was most difficult part, especially without using third party libraries. I designed it using simple css and tried best to clone it like the original one.
